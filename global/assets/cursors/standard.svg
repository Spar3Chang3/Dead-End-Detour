      This SVG creates a northwest-pointing arrow, sized for a cursor.
      - `width` and `height` set the display size.
      - `viewBox` defines the coordinate system.
      - `fill="none"` means the shape isn't filled with color.
      - `stroke="white"` sets the arrow color to white.
      - `stroke-width` sets the thickness of the line.
      - `stroke-linecap="round"` makes the ends of the lines circular.
      - `stroke-linejoin="round"` rounds the corners where lines meet.
